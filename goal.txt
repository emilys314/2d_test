enemy attacks your village while you save a lost dog.
you have to journey through now enemy territory to get to safe haeven.

## Idea
You go around hunting monsters (like the witcher) for locals. 
Choose if you kill them or try to make peace.
There is a vampire who kills livestock. You can: kill, or negotiate to stop.
## Gameplay
Low/no magic. Use sword and bow. Dash. Energy bar.
Sword fighting is samuri/blade runner like, super nice and fluid
Use dynamic environment for help?
